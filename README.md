# dir-cleaner

A program that wipes files in a specified directory

In order to use `dir-cleaner <path/to/directory>` instead of using `<path-to-dir-cleaner> <path-to-directory>`; edit '.bashrc' by adding  `alias dir-cleaner='<path/to/dir-cleaner>`' which is a hidden file in '~/' by default

"Usage of the script: `<path-to-dir-cleaner>` `<path-to-directory>`'
